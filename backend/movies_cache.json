Martha suggests, \"Has a little child ever changed your life?\" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the \"little child\" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's \"baby\" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. And Oliver, what becomes of him? Comedy Music Romance newspaper man"
